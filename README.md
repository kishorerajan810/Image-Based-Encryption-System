Problem Statement:
   In today’s era of digitalization and the internet, user authentication, the use of passwords, and the use of secret messages have been a centrepiece for decades. There is substantial research in the field of password security. Unfortunately, the methods of storing the passwords and their mechanism have failed to fetch enough attention from the researchers. In the past few years, a lot of researchers recommended the use of a combination of security methods like steganography and cryptography to elevate the security of the system. However, it still does not assure the security of the password. This proposes a system that implements multi-level encryption with decentralized and distributed storage of enterprises’ sensitive information and offers multi-layered security to the system. In this design, we introduce a password security equation, Data Protection = Encrypt + Hide + Split. According to our equation, we encrypt the password using AES-128, split it into pieces, and hide it behind the images using steganography adding another layer of encryption and storing it in a decentralized manner. When the user logs in to the system, all the password pieces are retrieved from all the steganographic images, merged, and decrypted to form a legitimate password in one piece.
